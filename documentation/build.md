[SpectorJS](../readme.md)
=========

## How to build and use locally
Like any simple typescript repository everything start with.

```
git clone https://github.com/BabylonJS/Spector.js.git
cd spector
npm install
```

Then you can use the following npm commands to speed your development:
1. ```npm start``` Will compile and run a local server with a watch command so that you can directly try your changes (TS or scss). Navigate to the the [embedded sample](http://localhost:1337/sample/index.html) to start playing with the dev tools.
2. ```npm run build``` Will create and build a new version of the dist folder files.
3. ```npm run clean``` Will clean all the generated files from the repo.

If you are looking for the temporary generated .js or .map files, they are all available in the built folder which is not under source control.

I would recommend developping on [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the entire setup is present so that if you install the chrome debugger extension you can directly debug from your typescript files by pressing F5.

As Tslint is part of the build checks, please run it locally before any PR. The easiest is to install the TsLint plugin in VsCode.
```npm run build:tslint```

## Available Samples
Once ```npm start``` has been launched, you can access the following samples to try your new features:

19. [Viewport](http://localhost:1337/sample/index.html?sample=viewPort): Test viewport capture in Render Targets.
20. [Offscreen](http://localhost:1337/sample/index.html?sample=offscreen): Test Offscreen canvas support.
21. [Scissor Clear](http://localhost:1337/sample/index.html?sample=scissorClear): Test scissor redundant calls when clearing.
22. [Custom Log](http://localhost:1337/sample/index.html?sample=customLog): Test the custom log functionnality.
22. [Pixelated Nearest](http://localhost:1337/sample/index.html?sample=texturePixelated): Test visual texture capture being pixelated on nearest.

You can also add &noSpy=1 at the end of the previous Urls to test without enabling the full spy before starting your rendering engine.

### Add more samples
To add a new sample, simply add a new script in the ```sample/js``` folder. To launch it you can use the following url by replacing the ```fileName``` by your new file name without the ```.js``` extension.

[http://localhost:1337/sample/index.html?sample=fileName](http://localhost:1337/sample/index.html?sample=fileName)

## Extension
As stated on the [extension documentation](extension.md), you can side load the extension. The main use cases to try out to test the captures are:

- [BabylonJS playground](http://www.babylonjs-playground.com/): Test a few of the available scenes.
- [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/models/09f6d0e4d611421bbd53d35f1ef013ec)
- [Sketchfab WebGL 2](https://sketchfab.com/models/4d9f1a93a4a04b08aec30a8f2f9c6fa2?webgl2=1)
- [Play Canvas Over the flood](https://playcanv.as/e/p/44MRmJRU/)
- [5000 Commands](http://marcinignac.com/experiments/deferred-rendering/demo/)
